The file "TIP_tutorial.ipynb" illustrates how to conduct TIM + TIP in Python through a jupyter notebook.
It also shows how our method is used to improve the six different models discussed in the main paper.
Only one example skin lesion image, contained in the "Image" folder, is used in this concise tutorial. 
More images can be obtained from https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com/task1/

The file "TDAimgprocess.py" contains code for our built functions for TIM + TIP, and is imported in the notebook.

The necessary packages are imported at the start of the "TIP_tutorial.ipynb" and "TDAimgprocess.py" files.
For conciseness, we list the required (nonstandard) Python libraries below.

- numpy
- matplotlib
- Pillow
- scikit-image
- OpenCV
- SciPy
- ripser
